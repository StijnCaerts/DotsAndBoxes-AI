\section{Conclusions}

We have created a semi-intelligent agent using Monte Carlo tree search which can dynamically keep track of an abstract board representation, allowing it to recognize chains and keep control in end-game once it has it. However, it doesn't know how to control the chain parity and as such usually loses against humans or other AI's with moderate skill. Unfortunately, artificial neural network heuristic doesn't seem to have a significant positive or negative effect.
