% List all libraries/code/pseudocode used?

We used other people's code for a couple of things:

\begin{itemize}
\item Java Websockets API (\url{https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket}): A library used to set up websockets.
\item GSON (\url{https://github.com/google/gson}): A library used for JSON parsing.
\item Alpha-beta pruning (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning#Pseudocode}): We made several improvements to this, however our first alpha-beta search was just a direct translation of this pseudocode.
\item Monte Carlo tree search by Dieter Buys (\url{https://github.com/DieterBuys/mcts-player})
\item JSAP (\url{http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/}): A library used for parsing command line arguments.
\end{itemize}
