% Problem statement

The problem posed in this course was to develop an agent which uses some machine learning techniques to play ``Dots and Boxes''. Furthermore, it should also be able to play on arbitrary board sizes without requiring retraining. An important aspect of the assignment is the ability to represent chains on the board and learn to recognize them.
