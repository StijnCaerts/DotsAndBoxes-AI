\section{Methodology}

% General methodology
Our general methodology is heavily based on the approach presented by Zhuang et al. [REFERENCE TO IMPROVING MCTS]. Although the additional requirement of variable board sizes was added (and this does technically cause some problems since it implies a variable feature vector length), we doubt this would be a significant issue to deal with. Unfortunately, their paper hardly covers any technical details and their source code is very extensive and undocumented, so we decided that it would be infeasible to adapt/translate this code to our own use within a reasonable timeframe for this course. Instead, we designed a simpler board representation which is able to keep track of all chains but doesn't support the precise categorization from the paper. The rest of the strategy is largely unchanged: we generate partially completed games, let an exact solver label them based on their best outcome, train an artificial neural network using a feature vector based on chains and then use this network as heuristic at certain points during our Monte Carlo tree search. An important addition we made was to use an insight from the paper by Barker and Korf (REFERENCE TO SOLVING DOTS AND BOXES) to recognize provably optimal moves, which helped both our solver and MCTS.
