\section*{Abstract}

For this course, we developed an agent to play the game ``Dots and Boxes''. It uses Monte Carlo tree search with some optimizations as its core, while relying on an artificial neural network as heuristic to judge the desirability of board outcomes during the search. To train this network, we generated a set of solved games, labelled with their actual outcome, using alpha-beta pruning with some game-specific-optimizations. These components rely on an abstract board representation we developed, which can represent different types of chains. For efficiency, this board representation can be updated dynamically so that it only requires a limited amount of operations to process a new move. Combining all of this resulted in a semi-intelligent agent which can beat novice players and AI's some of the time, but lacks strategic insight to play on a higher level.
