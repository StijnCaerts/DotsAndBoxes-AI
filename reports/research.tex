\section{Research questions}
\paragraph{Which strategy for game playing do you use?} % TODO
	
\paragraph{Which data representation do you use?} % TODO

\paragraph{Which machine learning model(s) do you use to represent the game state?} % TODO
	
\paragraph{How do you force a decision within a given time limit?} The search in the Monte Carlo search tree for a move is a iterative process, that can be stopped when the time limit is reached. Because we want to take some small overhead time into account, we reduced the time limit with 0.02 seconds to make sure the decision is made in time.
	
\paragraph{How will you evaluate your solution?} Evaluation is described in Section \ref{s:evaluation}.
	
\paragraph{What is the computational and memory cost of preprocessing, learning and evaluating?} description
	
\paragraph{Can you represent and learn to recognize the concept of chains, a popular strategy in ``Dots and Boxes''?} Yes, as described in Section \ref{s:chains}.
	
\paragraph{How does your best game playing strategy compare to your other strategies (performance)?} A comparison of our different playing strategies can be found in Section \ref{s:evaluationOwn}.
	
\paragraph{What is the performance/time/space trade-off between your different strategies?} % TODO
