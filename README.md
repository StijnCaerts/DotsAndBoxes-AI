# Dots and Boxes AI
AI agent for the game of Dots and Boxes made by Wouter Baert (@Wout12345) and Stijn Caerts (@StijnCaerts). This project was made as an assignment for the course [Machine Learning: Project](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0T25AE.htm) at KU Leuven in 2018. Our implementation of the AI agent was the third best submission of the course.
